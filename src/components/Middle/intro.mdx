# I’m Rob, an engineer from Melbourne, Australia.

I'm a graduate of Monash University where I studied Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics. While studying I was involved with the IT society [wired](http://wired.org.au), where I held the title of President in 2017.

Previously I worked as a Cloud Architect for [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com), where I built solutions for customers in the public sector, our clients included universities, government departments, and non-for-profits.

Before that I worked as a Software Engineer at [Localz](https://localz.com) who are providing last mile solutions for people around the world.

Right now I'm a committee member of [Young Engineers Australia](https://yea.engineersaustralia.org.au/) National Committee. Previously I was co-chair of the Victorian Committee where we ran events to connect and engage young engineers who are beginning their careers in Australia.

Currently I am a Software Engineer at [Redactive AI](https://redactive.ai) where we're solving AI enablement with out semantic security service.

I also helped run the [UNIHACK](https://unihack.net) organisation in Melbourne, where we ran hackathons for students around Australia.

I'm an avid runner and enjoy bouldering all around Melbourne and beyond.

Apart from that, I love gaming, karate, bike riding, and electronics and try to do at least one of these things every day. I’m always looking for something new and interesting to do, so feel free to browse my portfolio or view my resume if you want to see some of the cool things I’ve done.
