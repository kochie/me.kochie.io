This repo has has a few facelifts over the past couple of years but I'm pretty happy with it now. This repo contains a sire I've made to display some basic stuff about myself and what I'm currently working on. It's a simple react app built on top of `now`.

## To Build

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## To Deploy

```
now && now alias
```

## Caveats
It's currently not a generalised site, If you want to copy it you'll have to sanitise my personal information out of it.
